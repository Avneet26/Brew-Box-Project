# BrewBox

**Project**: Web Programming & Framework 2 - ITE-5425-0TA  
**Date**: July 2025

---

## 1. Project Overview

**BrewBox** is a subscription-based coffee delivery web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and the App Router. Users can customize and subscribe to receive coffee pods or beans based on their machine type (e.g., Nespresso, Keurig) and taste preferences. The system simulates a mock payment flow, stores product and subscription data in Firebase, and provides an admin dashboard for managing coffee offerings and subscriber information.

---

## 2. Target Audience

- Coffee enthusiasts with home coffee machines  
- Busy professionals seeking automated recurring coffee deliveries  
- New home brewers desiring convenience and customization  

---

## 3. Objectives

1. Allow users to select coffee by machine type, format (pods/beans), roast level, and subscription frequency.  
2. Simulate a complete checkout flow with mock payment confirmation.  
3. Persist subscription and product data in Firebase (Auth & Firestore).  
4. Offer an admin panel for CRUD operations on products and subscriber management.
